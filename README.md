# ProjectDeepLearning
Deep Learning project that merges an intresting Deep Net Music Composer with clever evaluation techiques for the generated music.
The composer was developed by @hackerpoet of CodeParade and a clarifying video can be found at https://github.com/HackerPoet/Composer <br/>
This was developed for the Deep Learning course (2019, Master Degree in Computer Science, University of Trento).
